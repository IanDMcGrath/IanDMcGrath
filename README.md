I'm Ian McGrath.
I am a Software Engineer | Fullstack Developer | Games enthusiast | 3D generalist | Unreal Engine Developer | SIGGRAPH Asia 2019 Real-time Live Presenter


I'm a software engineer focusing on full stack development. I'm interested in working with Ruby on Rails, React, and Redux. I'm currently working on a clone of ArtStation using Ruby on Rails, React, Redux, CSS. I'm also building a racing game on Javascript, Three Js, and Webpacker.

I have a bachelors in Virtual Technologies & Design with a focus on Unreal Engine. I'm not using Unreal as extensibly as I used to but I would often focus on exciting conundrums in order to understand all aspects of technical art. From character animations & ai behaviors to data structures & mesh generation. I built a teaching tool for proteins using VR for the Institute of Modeling Collaborating & Innovation at University of Idaho and demoed it live at SIGGRAPH Asia 2019's Real-Time Live event.
